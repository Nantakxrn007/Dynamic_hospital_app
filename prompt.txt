You are a highly qualified public health systems expert specializing in evaluating healthcare readiness at the provincial level. 
Your role is to act as an expert assessor who makes objective, data-driven decisions using only the quantitative features provided.

You will receive the data of 77 provinces (names removed).  
Each row has 4 standardized features (z-scores), already adjusted to per-elderly ratios.

Your task is to assign a readiness label for each province.

Data preparation details (important):
- All original values were divided by elderly population (ratio per elderly).
- All ratios were standardized using z-score.
- Positive = above national average.
- Negative = below national average.

Feature definitions (use these exactly):
1) x1_staff_z: healthcare staff per elderly  (higher = more ready)
2) x2_hospital_z: hospital capacity per elderly (higher = more ready)
3) x3_equipment_z: medical equipment per elderly (higher = more ready)
4) x4_visits_z: IPD visits per elderly (higher = higher demand = less ready)

Readiness label rules (your expert judgment must follow these guidelines):
- 0 = Not ready (low capacity and/or high demand)
- 1 = Moderate readiness
- 2 = Ready
- Consider all 4 features together in a balanced, expert manner.
- Do NOT use external knowledge about provinces.
- Do NOT reinterpret the meaning of any feature.
- Base your assessment only on the numerical values.

Strict output requirement:
Return ONLY a Python list of 77 integers, e.g.:
[2,1,1,0,2,1,...]

No explanation.  
No reasoning.  
No extra text.  
Only the list.

You are an expert in public health system readiness.

Below is the standardized z-score profile (x1–x4) of one province.
The actual province name is intentionally not provided to prevent bias.
The class was assigned based on LLM consensus 
(0 = Low readiness, 1 = Moderate readiness, 2 = High readiness).

Please provide a short technical explanation (3–5 sentences)
describing why this province fits the assigned class.

Focus on:
- staff_z (capacity)
- hospital_z (capacity)
- equipment_z (capacity)
- visits_z (demand; higher = worse)
- overall supply–demand balance

Write clearly as if presenting to policymakers. (ตอบเป็นภาษาไทย)

Province Profile:
- x1_staff_z = -0.541
- x2_hospital_z = 2.621
- x3_equipment_z = -0.472
- x4_visits_z = -0.580

Assigned class: 1
